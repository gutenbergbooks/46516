<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>While strolling through a piece of woodland, or perhaps along the marsh or
seashore, we see a bird, a strange bird&mdash;one we never saw before. Instantly,
our curiosity is aroused, and the question arises, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; There is the bird!
How can we find out what kind it is? The Ornithologist of a few years ago had
but one course open to him, that is to shoot the bird, take it home, then pore through
pages of descriptions, until one was found to correspond with the specimen. Obviously,
such methods cannot be pursued today, both humane and economical reasons
prohibiting. We have but one alternative left us: We must make copious
notes of all the peculiarities and markings of the bird that is before us. On our
return home, we get down our bird books, and there are many excellent ones. After
carefully looking through the whole library, we find that, although many of our
books are well illustrated, none of them has the picture of what we seek, so we adopt
the tactics of the &ldquo;Old-time&rdquo; Ornithologist, before mentioned, and pore over pages
of text, until finally we know what our bird was. It is for just such emergencies
as this&mdash;to identify a bird when you see it, and where you see it, that this little
pocket &ldquo;Bird Guide&rdquo; is prepared. May it be the medium for saving many of today&rsquo;s
seekers for &ldquo;bird truths&rdquo; from the many trials and tribulations willingly
encountered, and hard and thorny roads gladly traveled by the author in his quest
for knowledge of bird ways.</p>

<h2 id="c2">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The study of the birds included in this book is much more difficult than that
of the small land birds. Many of the birds are large; some are very rare; all are
usually shy and have keen eyesight, trained to see at a distance; in fact, many of
them have to depend upon their vigilance for their very existence. Therefore,
you will find that the majority of these birds will have to be studied at long range.
Sometimes, by exercising care and forethought, you may be able to approach within
a few feet of the bird you seek, or induce him to come to you. It is this pitting
your wits against the cunning of the birds that furnishes one-half of the interest
in their study. Remember that a quick motion will always cause a bird to fly.
If you seek a flock of plover on the shore, or a heron in the marsh, try to sneak up
behind cover if possible; if not, walk very slowly, and with as little motion as possible,
directly towards them; by so doing you often will get near, for a bird is a poor judge
of distance, while a single step sideways would cause him to fly. Shore birds can
usually be best observed from a small &ldquo;blind,&rdquo; near the water&rsquo;s edge, where they
feed. Your powers of observation will be increased about tenfold if you are equipped
with a good pair of field glasses; they are practically indispensable to the serious
student and add greatly to the pleasures of anyone. Any good glass, that has a wide
field of vision and magnifies three or four diameters, is suitable; we can recommend
the ones described in the back of this book.</p>
<p>WHAT TO MAKE NOTE OF.&mdash;What is the nature of the locality where
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
seen; marsh, shore, woods, etc? If in trees does it sit upright or horizontal? If
on the ground, does it run or walk, easily or with difficulty? If in the water, can
it swim well, can it dive, does it swim under water, can it fly from the water easily,
or does it have to patter over the surface before flying? What does it seem to be
eating? Does it have any notes? Does it fly rapidly; with rapid wing beats or
not; in a straight line or otherwise? Does it sail, or soar? In flocks or singly?
These and hundreds of other questions that may suggest themselves, are of great
interest and importance.</p>
<p>A PLEA TO SPORTSMEN.&mdash;Many of the birds shown in this book are Game
Birds, that is, birds that the law allows you to shoot at certain seasons of the year.
Some of these are still abundant and will be for numbers of years; others are very
scarce and if they are further hunted, will become entirely exterminated in two or
three years. Bob-whites are very scarce in New England; Prairie Hens are becoming
scarce in parts of the west; the small Curlew is practically extinct, while
the larger ones are rapidly going. In behalf of all bird lovers, we ask that you refrain
from killing those species that you know are rare, and use moderation in the taking
of all others. We also ask that you use any influence that may be yours to further
laws prohibiting all traffic in birds. The man who makes his living shooting birds
will make more, live longer and die happier tilling the soil than by killing God&rsquo;s
creatures. We do not, now, ask you to refrain from hunting entirely, but get your
sport at your traps. It takes more skill to break a clay pigeon than to kill a quail.</p>

<img src="images/p009.jpg" alt="ORDER 1. DIVING BIRDS&mdash;Pygopodes." width="500" height="579" />
</div>
<p>GREBES; Colymbid&aelig;:&mdash;Form, duck-like; bill pointed
and never flattened; no tail; legs at extreme
end of body; each flattened toe with an individual web;
wings small. Flies rapidly, but patters along the water
before taking wing. Expert divers, using wings as
well as feet, to propel them, under water.</p>
<p>LOONS. Family Gaviid&aelig;:&mdash;Larger than Grebes;
bill long, heavy, and pointed; tail very short; feet
webbed like a duck&rsquo;s, but legs thin and deep; form
and habits, grebe-like.</p>
<p>AUKS, MURRES, PUFFINS. Family Alcid&aelig;:&mdash;Bills
very variable; tail short; usually takes flight
when alarmed, instead of diving as do grebes and loons.
With the exception of puffins, which stand on their
feet, all birds of this order sit upon their whole leg and
tail. They are awkward on land; some can hardly
walk.</p>

</div>
<p>SKUAS, JAEGERS. Family Stercorariid&aelig;:&mdash;Marine
birds of prey; bill strongly hooked, with long scaly
shield, or cere, at the base; claws strong and curved,
hawk-like; flight hawk-like; plumage often entirely
sooty-black, and always so on the back.</p>
<p>GULLS, TERNS. Family Larid&aelig;:&mdash;Gulls have
hooked bills, usually yellowish, yellow eyes and pale,
webbed feet. Heap, underparts and square tail are
white in adults; back, pearl-grey; exceptions are the
four small black-headed gulls, which also have reddish
legs. Gulls fly with the bill straight in front, and
often rest on the water. Terns have forked tails, black
caps, and their slender, pointed bills and small webbed
feet are usually red. They fly with bill pointed down,
and dive upon their prey.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">1. </span><span class="sci">&AElig;chmophorus occidentalis. </span><span class="siz">25 to 29 inches.</span></div>
<p>All grebes have lobate-webbed feet, that is each toe
has its individual web, being joined to its fellow only
for a short distance at the base.</p>
<p>This, the largest of our grebes, is frequently known
as the &ldquo;Swan Grebe&rdquo; because of its extremely long, thin
neck. In summer the back of the neck is black, but
in winter it is gray like the back.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;Loud, quavering and cackling.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A floating mass of decayed rushes, sometimes
attached to upright stalks. The 2 to 5 eggs are pale,
bluish white, usually stained (2.40 &times; 1.55). They
breed in colonies.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Western North America, from the Dakotas
and Manitoba to the Pacific, and north to southern
Alaska. Winters in the Pacific coast states and
Mexico.</p>

<p>This is next to the <a href="#bWesternGrebe">Western Grebe</a> in size, both being
much larger than any of our others. In summer, they
are very handsomely marked with a reddish brown neck,
silvery white cheeks and throat, and black crown and
crest, but in winter they take on the usual grebe dress
of grayish above and glossy white below. Because of
their silky appearance and firm texture, grebe breasts
of all kinds have been extensively used in the past to
adorn hats of women, who were either heedless or ignorant
of the wholesale slaughter that was carried on
that they might obtain them.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of decayed rushes like that of the last. Not
in as large colonies; more often single pairs will be
found nesting with other varieties. Their eggs average
smaller than those of the last species (2.35 &times; 1.25).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;North America, breeding most abundantly in
the interior of Canada, and to some extent in the Dakotas.
Winters in the U. S., chiefly on the coasts.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">3. </span><span class="sci">Colymbus auritus. </span><span class="siz">14 inches.</span></div>
<p>As is usual with grebes, summer brings a remarkable
change in the dress of these birds. The black, puffy
head is adorned with a pair of buffy white ear tufts
and the foreneck is a rich chestnut color. In winter,
they are plain gray and white but the secondaries are
always largely white, as they are in the two preceding
and the following species. The grebe diet consists almost
wholly of small fish, which they are very expert
at pursuing and catching under water. One that I kept
in captivity in a large tank, for a few weeks, would
never miss catching the shiners, upon which he was fed,
at the first lightning-like dart of his slender neck. They
also eat quantities of shell fish, and I doubt if they will
refuse any kind of flesh, for they always have a keen
appetite.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A slovenly built pile of vegetation floating in
the &ldquo;sloughs&rdquo; of western prairies. The 3 to 7 eggs are
usually stained brownish yellow (1.70 &times; 1.15).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds from Northern Illinois and So. Dakota
northward; winters from northern U. S. to the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">4. </span><span class="sci">Colymbus nigricollis californicus. </span><span class="siz">13 inches.</span></div>
<p>This is a western species rarely found east of the
Mississippi. In summer, it differs from the last in having
the entire neck black; in winter it can always be
distinguished from the <a href="#bHornedGrebe">Horned Grebe</a> by its slightly
upcurved bill, while the upper mandible of the last is
convex. In powers of swimming and diving, grebes are
not surpassed by any of our water birds. They dive
at the flash of a gun and swim long distances before
coming to the surface; on this account they are often
called &ldquo;devil divers.&rdquo; They fly swiftly when once a-wing,
but their concave wings are so small that they have to
patter over the water with their feet in order to rise.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;They nest in colonies, often in the same sloughs
with <a href="#bHornedGrebe">Horned</a> and <a href="#bWesternGrebe">Western Grebes</a>, laying their eggs
early in June. The 4 to 7 eggs are dull white, usually
stained brownish, and cannot be separated from those
of the last.</p>

<p>This is much smaller than any others of our grebes;
in breeding plumage it most nearly resembles the following
species, but the bill is black and sharply pointed.
It has a black patch on the throat, and the crown and
back of the head are glossy blue black; in winter, the
throat and sides of the head are white.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Not different from those of the other grebes.
Only comparatively few of them breed in the U. S. but
they are common in Mexico and Central America. Their
eggs, when first laid, are a pale, chalky, greenish white,
but they soon become discolored and stained so that they
are a deep brownish, more so than any of the others;
from 3 to 6 eggs is a full complement (1.40 &times; .95).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Found in the United States, only in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley in Southern Texas, and southwards

<p>In any plumage this species cannot be mistaken for
others, because of its stout compressed bill and brown
iris; all the others have red eyes. In summer the bill
is whitish with a black band encircling it; the throat
is black; the eye encircled by a whitish ring; the breast
and sides are brownish-gray. In winter they are brownish-black
above and dull white below, with the breast
and sides washed with brown. Young birds have more
or less distinct whitish stripes on the head.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A loud, ringing &ldquo;kow-kow-kow-kow (repeated
many times and ending in) kow-uh, kow-uh.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of decayed rushes floating in reed-grown ponds
or edges of lakes. The pile is slightly hollowed and, in
this, the 5 to 8 eggs are laid; the bottom of the nest is
always wet and the eggs are often partly in the water;
they are usually covered with a wet mass when the bird
is away. Brownish-white (1.70 &times; 1.15).</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">7. </span><span class="sci">Gavia immer. </span><span class="siz">31 to 35 inches.</span></div>
<p>In form, loons resemble large grebes, but their feet
are full webbed like those of a duck; they have short,
stiff tails and long, heavy, pointed bills. They have no
tufts or ruffs in breeding season, but their plumage
changes greatly. The common loon is very beautifully
and strikingly marked with black and white above, and
white below; the head is black, with a crescent across
the throat and a ring around the neck. In winter, they
are plain gray above and white below.</p>
<p>Loons are fully as expert in diving and swimming as
are the grebes. They are usually found in larger, more
open bodies of water.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A loud, quavering, drawn-out &ldquo;wah-hoo-o-o.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Sometimes built of sticks, and sometimes simply
a hollow in the sand or bank under overhanging
bushes, usually on an island. The 2 eggs are brownish
with a few black specks (3.50 &times; 2.25).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;N. A., breeding from northern U. S. northwards;

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">9. </span><span class="sci">Gavia arctica. </span><span class="siz">28 inches.</span></div>
<p>This loon lives in the Arctic regions and only rarely
is found, in winter, in Northern United States. In summer,
it can readily be distinguished from the common
loon by the gray crown and hind-neck, as well as by
different arrangement of the black and white markings.
In winter, they are quite similar to the last species but
can be recognized by their smaller size, and can be distinguished
from the winter plumaged <a href="#bRedThroatedLoon">Red-throated Loon</a>
by the absence of any white markings on the back.
Like the grebes, loons have to run over the surface of
the water in order to take flight, and they are practically
helpless when on land. Their flight is very rapid,
in a straight line, and their neck is carried at full
length in front. This species has red eyes, as do all
the other loons.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;The same as the last species, but the two eggs
have more of an olive tint and are smaller (3.10 &times; 2.00).</p>

<p>Besides being smaller than the <a href="#bLoonGreatNorthernDiver">common loon</a>, this
species has a more slender bill, which has a slightly
up-turned appearance owing to the straight top to the
upper mandible; in summer, its back and head are gray,
with no white spots, although the back of the head has
a few white streaks; there is a large patch of chestnut
on the fore-neck; the under parts are white. In winter,
it is gray above and white below, but the back is sprinkled
with small white spots; at this season it can easily
be distinguished from <a href="#bHolboellGrebe">Holb&oelig;ll Grebe</a> by the absence of
any white patch in the wings as well as by the differently
shaped feet.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A depression in the sand or ground, not more
than a foot or two from the water&rsquo;s edge, so they can
slide from their two eggs into their natural element.
The eggs, which are laid in June, are olive-brown,
specked with black (2.90 &times; 1.75).</p>

<p>Puffins are grotesque birds, with short legs, stout
bodies and very large, thin bills, that of the common
Puffin being 2 in. in length and about the same in
height; the bill is highly colored with red and yellow,
and the feet are red; eyes, white. It will be noticed
that the blackish band across the throat does not touch
the chin, this distinguishing it from the Horned Puffin
of the Pacific coast. Adults in winter shed the greater
portion of their bill, lose the little horns that project
over the eye, and the face is blackish; they then resemble
young birds. They live on rocky shores, the
more precipitous the better. They stand erect upon
their feet and walk with ease.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A low croak.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;They breed in large colonies on rocky cliffs,

<p>These birds are very abundant about the rocky islands
from Maine northward. They may be seen sitting in
rows on the edges of the rocks, or pattering along the
water as they rise in flight, from its surface, at a boat&rsquo;s
approach. In summer the plumage is entirely black,
except the large white patches on the wings; legs red;
eyes brown. This species has the bases of the greater
coverts black, while they are white in Mandt Guillemot
(C. mandtii&mdash;No. 28), which is found from Labrador
northward. In winter, these birds are mottled gray and
white above, and white below, but the patches still show.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A shrill, piercing, squealing whistle.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Guillemots lay two eggs upon the bare rock or

bill, long and stout, 1.7 in. long, while that of Brunnich
Murre (Uria lomvia&mdash;No. 31), is shorter (1.25 in.) and
more swollen. The ranges and habits of the two species

<p>Similar in size and form to the <a href="#bMurre">murre</a>, but with a
short, deep, thin black bill, crossed by a white line. In
summer, with a white line from the eye to top of bill,
and with a brownish black throat; in winter, without
the white line and with the throat and sides of head
white. They nest and live in large colonies, usually in
company with murres. Their food, like that of the
murres, puffins and guillemots is of fish and shell fish,
or marine worms. They get these from the rockweed
along the shores or by diving; they are good swimmers,
using both their feet and wings to propel them through
the water, the same as do the grebes and loons.</p>

<p>This largest of the auks lived, as far as we have
authentic record, until 1844, when it became extinct,
largely through the agency of man. Although nearly
twice as long a bird as the <a href="#bRazorBilledAuk">Razor-billed Auk</a>, their wings
were shorter than those of that bird, being only a trifle
longer than those of the little Dovekie; they were flightless,
but the wings were used to good advantage in swimming.
Being in the direct line of travel between the
old world and the new, sailors, on passing vessels, killed
countless numbers of them for food, and in some cases
merely for the love of slaughter. They lived on coasts
and islands of the Atlantic from Mass., northwards.
There are about seventy mounted birds preserved, of
which five or six, as well as some skeletons, are in this
country.</p>
<p>Their eggs resemble those of the Razor-bill but, of
course, are much larger (5.00 &times; 3.00). About 70 of
these are in existence, six being in this country (Washington,
Phila., and four recently purchased by John E.
Thayer, of Lancaster, Mass.).</p>

<p>These little auks, called &ldquo;ice birds&rdquo; by the fishermen,
are very abundant in the far north. In summer, they
have a blackish brown throat and breast, but they are
never seen in the United States or southern parts of
the British possessions in that plumage. In winter,
their throats and sides of the head are white as well
as the rest of their upper parts. At all seasons the
edges of the scapulars and tips of the secondaries are
white, as are usually spots on each eyelid. Even in
winter, they are only casually found on our coast, for
they keep well out at sea. Occasionally they are blown
inland by storms and found with their feet frozen fast
in the ice of some of our ponds or lakes.</p>

them in crevices of sea cliffs; size 1.80 &times; 1.25.</p>

<p>These large birds are the most powerful and audacious
pirates among the sea fowl of northern waters. Their
whole form is indicative of strength; form robust, feet
strong, and bill large, powerful and hooked. Their
plumage is of a nearly uniform blackish-brown, with
white shafts to the wing feathers and a white patch
at the base of the primaries.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;They do not nest in large colonies, only a single
or a few pairs breeding in the same locality. Their
nests are hollows in the ground, a short distance back
from the rocky shores. The two eggs that they lay are
olive brown, spotted with blackish (2.75 &times; 1.90).</p>

<p>Jaegers are more slender in form than the Skuas, but
like them are piratical in their habits, preying chiefly
upon terns. Off Chatham, Mass., I have often watched
them in pursuit of the graceful terns, but, excellent
fliers as the latter birds are, they were always overtaken
and forced to drop the fish that they carried, and
the jaeger would rarely miss catching it as it fell. This
species has two color phases independent of sex or age.
In the light plumage the top of the head is black; rest
of the upper parts and the under tail coverts brownish
black; underparts and bases of primaries, white. Dark
phase,&mdash;Entirely blackish brown except the white shafts
to wing feathers and bases Of primaries. In any plumage
they can be distinguished from the other species
by the rounded, lengthened central tail feathers.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A hollow in the ground in marshy places. The
two eggs are olive brown spotted with black.</p>

<p>Differs from all other terns in the shape of its black
bill, which is stout, but with the upper mandible not
hooked nor curved, as in the gulls. Tail forked about
1.5 in. Adults have the crown black in summer, while
in winter the head is white, with the nape and spot in
front of eye, black mixed with white. Young birds are
similar to winter adults but have the back feathers
margined with brownish, and the neck streaked with
gray. This species is found only on our South Atlantic
and Gulf coasts, and is not abundant anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A high, thin, somewhat reedy &ldquo;tee-tee-tee,&rdquo;

<p>This species is the most gracefully formed of the terns.
The tail is 7.5 in. long, forked to a depth of 5.25 in.
In summer, the bill is blackish, changing to red only at
the base. The underparts are a beautiful rosy tint in
the breeding season; tail entirely white; feet red. In
winter the usual changes occur, and young birds have
dusky edges to the feathers of the back and wings.
Terns are now becoming more abundant on our coast,
their slaughter and persecution for millinery purposes
fortunately having been stopped in time to prevent their
extinction.</p>
<p>They feed chiefly upon small fish and marine insects,
and often gather about fishing boats, waiting for an

eyes brown; bill and feet yellowish. In the dark phase
they are uniformly gray above and below. These plumages
appear to be independent of sex or age. They are

abundant of the shearwaters found off our coast. They
are constant attendants of the fishermen when they are
at work, and at other times are usually to be seen
flying low over the water, or resting in large bodies
upon its surface. Their flight is peculiar and distinctive,&mdash;three
flaps of the wings then a short sail, repeated
over and over. Possibly this habit is acquired
by their swooping down into the troughs of waves, then
flapping to clear the next crest. They are very greedy
and continually quarreling among themselves in order
to get the lion&rsquo;s share of the food. They are called
&ldquo;Haglets&rdquo; by the fishermen.</p>

are expert swimmers on the surface of the water, but
I have never seen one dive. Their food is almost if not
wholly composed of oily refuse gathered from the surface
of the water. In order to take flight, they paddle
along the water a few steps; it is difficult for them to
rise, except against the wind. If you sail upon them
from the windward, they go squawking and pattering
over the water in all directions, and can frequently be
caught in nets. They are very tame, and will sometimes

<p>Bill, face and naked throat pouch, slaty-blue; eye
yellow; feet reddish. Plumage white except the primaries,
secondaries and other tail feathers, which are
black. Young birds are streaked above with gray and
brownish, and are dull white below. Boobies are birds
of wide distribution in the Tropics, this species being
rarely seen in southern Florida, but quite abundant on
some of the West Indian islands. Owing to the numerous
air cells beneath their skin, they are very buoyant
and can ride the waves with ease during severe storms.
They secure their prey, which is chiefly fish, by plunging
after it.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Their one or two eggs are laid usually upon
the bare ground on low islands, or sometimes in weed-lined
hollows. The eggs are pure white, covered with
a thick chalky deposit (2.50 &times; 1.70).</p>

<p>This species, commonly called the Brown Booby, is
brownish black with the exception of a white breast and
underparts. Young birds are entirely brownish black;
bill and feet greenish yellow; eye white. They are
one of the most abundant breeding birds upon many of
the Bahaman and West Indian Islands. They have
great powers of flight and dart about with the speed
of arrows, carrying their long bill and neck at full
length before them. They are awkward walkers, and,
owing to their buoyancy, it is difficult for them to
swim under water, but they are unerring in securing
their prey by plunging upon it from a height.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;They breed in colonies of thousands, laying
their two eggs upon the bare sand or rocks. The eggs
are chalky white, more or less nest stained (2.40 &times;

northerly distributed of the gannet family. Thousands
upon thousands of them breed upon high rocky islets
off the British coast. The only known nesting places
used by them in this country are Bird Rock and Bonaventure

Middle tail feathers curiously crimped. These peculiar
birds spend their lives within the recesses of swamps,
the more dismal and impenetrable, the better. They
perch on limbs overhanging the water and dive after
fish, frogs, lizards, etc., that pass beneath, from which
they get one of their names, American Darter. They
swim with the body submerged, with only their serpent-like

Adults with glossy black head, neck and underparts;
in breeding season with white plumes on the neck and
a white patch on the flanks. Young with throat and
belly white, rest of underparts mixed brown with black.
Cormorants feed chiefly upon fish which they pursue

and are now to a less extent, used by the Chinese to
catch fish for them, a ring being placed around their
neck to prevent their swallowing their prey.</p>

<p>Tail with 12 feathers; distinguished from the last
species in any plumage by the shape of the gular sac;
on the common Cormorant the feathers on the throat
extend forward to a point, making the hind end of the
pouch heart-shaped, while in the present species it is
convex. In breeding plumage, this species has a tuft of
black feathers on either side of the head. The throat
pouch is orange yellow; eyes green. These cormorants
are found to some extent along the Atlantic coast, in
summer, from Maine northward, but they are chiefly
birds of the interior, being particularly abundant in
Manitoba.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On ledges on the coast, and on the ground in
the interior, or in trees. The nests are made of sticks
and weeds, shallow, shabby platforms holding 3 or 4
eggs. The eggs are bluish-green and chalky.</p>

<p>Adults with feathers bordering on the gular sac, white.
In breeding plumage, the sides of head and neck have
tufts of filmy white feathers, eyes green, as they are in
all cormorants. All cormorants are expert swimmers
and fishermen. They never plunge for their prey, but
pursue and catch it under water, the same as do the
grebes. When perching, they sit erect with their neck
bent in the form of a letter S. They fly with their
necks outstretched, and with rather slow wing beats.
They are very gregarious and nest in large colonies,
this species always being found in swamps or heavy
shrubbery, surrounding bodies of water.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually in trees overhanging the water, or

<p>White with black primaries. Eye white; bill and
feet yellow, the former in the breeding season being
adorned with a thin upright knob about midway on the
top of the upper mandible. The large pouch, with which
pelicans are armed, is used as a dip net to secure their
food, which consists of small fish. The White Pelican
scoops up fish as he swims along the surface of the
water; when he has his pouch partially filled, he tilts
his head, contracts the pouch, thereby squeezing the water
out of the sides of his mouth, and swallows his fish.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of sticks and weeds on the ground on islands
or shores of inland lakes. They breed in colonies, and
lay their eggs in June. The two or three eggs are pure

head is white. These pelicans nest abundantly on some
of the islands on the Gulf coast of the U. S., on Pelican
Island on the east coast of Florida, and sometimes on
the coast of Georgia and South Carolina. Like the
<a href="#bWhitePelican">White Pelican</a>, this species lives chiefly upon small fish,
but they procure them in a different manner. They are
continually circling about at a low elevation above the
water and, upon sighting a school of fish, will plunge
headfirst into it, securing as many as possible.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Either on the ground or in low trees, in the
latter case being more bulky than in the former; composed
of sticks and weeds. The three to five eggs that
they lay are pure white with the chalky covering common
to eggs of birds belonging to this order.</p>

<p>Eye brown; bill long, comparatively slender, and flesh,
colored; gular sac orange; feet small and weak, with
the four toes joined by webs. Frigate birds are strictly
maritime; they nest in large colonies and usually travel
in large companies. In expanse of wing compared to
size of body they are unequalled by any other bird, and
in power of flight they are only surpassed, possibly, by
the albatrosses. They can walk only with difficulty and
are very poor swimmers, owing to their small feet and
long tail, but they are complete masters of the air
and delight to soar at great heights. Their food of
small fish is secured by plunging, or preying upon
other sea birds.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A low, frail platform of sticks in the tops of
bushes or low trees. They lay but a single white egg

<p>Bill, feet and eye red in male, the former with a black
stripe along the top; plumage black and white, with a
greenish-black head; no crest. Female gray and white,
with brown head, crested; chin white; eye yellow. These
birds have the bill long, not flattened, but edged with
sharp teeth to grasp the fish, upon which they live to a
great extent. They are exceptionally good swimmers
for members of this family, and can chase and catch
their fish, using their wings to aid their legs in propelling
them through the water.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In holes of trees, cavities among the rocks, or

and a band across his breast is mixed rusty and
black streaks. The female has not as brightly colored
a head as the female of the <a href="#bAmericanMerganser">American Merganser</a>, and
the throat is not pure white. They can be distinguished

<p>Head reddish-brown; speculum and large patch back
of eye, green; a white crescent in front of wing. Female
with the head and neck whitish, finely streaked with
dusky; wings as in male. These ducks are abundant in
most parts of the United States, but are rather uncommon
in New England. They are usually seen in flocks
of ten or a dozen, and often a single bird, or two or
three, may be found with a flock of <a href="#bMallard">Mallards</a>. They
frequent ponds, marshes and rush-grown shores of creeks,
rivers or lakes, feeding upon shellfish, insects, aquatic
plants and seeds.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;Shrill, piping whistles, rapidly repeated.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On the ground under the shelter of tall grass;
it is made of weeds and grass, and lined with feathers.

<p>Male.&mdash;Head gray, with a white crescent in front of
the eye; underparts buffy, heavily spotted with black;
wing coverts blue; speculum green. Female similar to
the female <a href="#bGreenWingedTeal">Green-winged Teal</a>, but with blue wing coverts.
Teal can easily be distinguished from other ducks
by their small size; the present species can usually be
separated from the last, by the darker underparts, the
longer neck and smaller head. Their flight is very
rapid; it probably appears to be more rapid than that
of other ducks because of the much smaller size of the
Teal. They usually fly in compact lines and when ready
to alight, do so very precipitously.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A weak, but rapidly uttered quacking.</p>

similar to the female Blue-wing, but more rusty below,
and the throat is tinted or quite dark, while that of
the last species is usually light. These beautiful birds
are very abundant west of the Rocky Mountains, but
are of only casual or accidental occurrence east of the
Mississippi Valley and sometimes Southern Florida.
Their favorite nesting places are in fields of tall grass
or clover, in close proximity to marshes or ponds.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Compactly woven of grasses and lined with

<p>Bill long, and much broader at the tip than at the

breast and back, white; wing coverts, pale blue; eye
yellow; feet orange. Female with head, neck and underparts,
brownish-yellow, specked or streaked with dusky;
wings as in the male, but not as brightly colored.
Easily recognized in any plumage by the large, broad
bill. If it were not for this large and ungainly shaped
bill, this species might be classed as one of our most
beautiful ducks, when in full plumage, which is only
during the breeding season; at other seasons the head
of the male is largely mixed with blackish.</p>

<p>Tail pointed, and, in the male, with the two central
feathers considerably lengthened; neck unusually long
and slender for a duck; form more slender than that
of other ducks. Male with brownish head and stripe
down back of neck; back and sides barred with black

Female mottled brownish, buffy and black, but to be
known by the sharply pointed tail feathers and long
neck; speculum brownish. These ducks are strong swimmers
and good fliers, but poor divers; they get their
food the same as does the <a href="#bMallard">Mallard</a> by &ldquo;tipping up,&rdquo;
their long neck enabling them to feed in comparatively
deep water. They are quite timid and lurk in the tall
grass of the marshes during the daytime, feeding chiefly
after dark.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;Quacks like those of the <a href="#bMallard">Mallard</a>.</p>

<p>Head crested in both sexes, the feathers being especially
lengthened on the nape. No other American duck
that can possibly be mistaken for them. The male
Wood Duck is the most beautiful of the family, in this
or any other country, its only rival being the gaily colored
Mandarin, of China. In summer, they may be
found about the edges of clear ponds or lakes, especially
those located in woods remote from human habitations.
They are very local in their distribution and only one
or two pairs will be found in a locality. In most parts
of their range they are rapidly diminishing in numbers.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A soft whistled &ldquo;peet, peet&rdquo; and a squawky

<p>Note the shape of the bill of this species, as compared
to that of the similarly colored <a href="#bCanvasBack">Canvas-back</a>. The male
Redhead has a bluish bill with a black tip, and his back
is much darker than that of the Canvas-back; eye yellow.
The female has the throat white and the back
plain grayish-brown, without bars. Redheads dive and
swim with great agility; they feed largely upon water
plants and mollusks which they get from the bottom of
ponds, or along the seashore. They breed very abundantly
in the sloughs of the prairies in the Northwest.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A hollow, rapid croaking.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of grasses, lined with feathers, in marshes.
Their 6 to 12 eggs are buffy white (2.40 &times; 1.70); May,

<p>Differs from the <a href="#bRedhead">Redhead</a> in the shape of its black
bill, its blackish forehead, very light back and red eyes.
The female has the back grayish-brown, finely barred
with black. Like the last species, Canvas-backs are
excellent swimmers and divers, and can secure their
food from a considerable depth. In winter they are
found in great abundance on the Atlantic coast from
Maryland southward, and are one of the most persistently
hunted birds, for their flesh is much esteemed,
and they have a high market value. They are seen in
large flocks, and are difficult to approach, but are said
to decoy as easily as any other.</p>

ducks. Their flight is very rapid, and they are
equally agile when in the water. They are seen on
the Atlantic coast only in winter, and remain just as
far north as the water remains open.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A low grunting &ldquo;quanck.&rdquo;</p>

They are known by a great variety of names such as
&ldquo;Butter Ball,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spirit Duck,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dipper,&rdquo; etc., the majority
of which refer to the celerity with which they
can disappear under the water. They are always on
the alert and will dive at the flash of a gun. They are
able to continue incessant diving for a long period and
can remain under water for a long time. Their flight is

<p>This species is one of the very few ducks that change
their plumages in summer and winter. The female is
marked similarly to the male but is very much duller
colored, and lacks the long tail feathers with which
the male is adorned. They are sea ducks and, while
they are usually found to some extent on some of the
larger lakes or ponds, during migrations, they are very
abundant on the Atlantic coast. They are excellent
swimmers and dive to great depths in search of food.
It is said (Nelson) that in their summer home, during
the mating season, they frequently dive under the water
from the air, a habit that none of the other ducks, except
rarely the Pintail, indulge in.</p>

<p>Male very oddly and handsomely marked, as shown;
female blackish-brown, lighter below and with a whitish
spot before and one behind each eye. During the winter,
they are seen in flocks off the coast, from Maine
and sometimes from Long Island Sound northward. In
summer, they are usually found only in pairs along
rivers or creeks, and in the Rocky Mountains they frequent
the turbulent streams that are the homes of the
Water Ouzel. When swimming, Harlequins sit high in
the water, but they are able to get under the surface
with the greatest of speed.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A rapidly uttered, clattering whistle.</p>

entire underparts, black. Female mottled brownish-gray
and blackish, with white speculum.</p>
<p>Labrador Ducks were never very abundant within the
memory of any living person, but they were occasionally
shot and were found sometimes in the New York
markets. At that time little heed was paid to them
and they became extinct before anyone realized the
fact. Their record has been traced down to 1875, since
which time none have been taken. As far as known
there are but 38 or 40 of them preserved. They were

<p>Base of bill extends on either side of forehead in a
point, a mark that will distinguish it from the next

Eider presents a most remarkable difference in plumage
from that of the male, and, unlike the females of most

<p>The feathers of the sides of the bill of this species
do not reach to the nostril, while in the two preceding
ones, they do. This is the chief point of difference in
distinguishing the females, which very closely resemble
each other. Adult males, as can be seen, are very different
from the other Eiders. As is usual with the
Eiders, the male of this species moults to a plumage
resembling that of the female, during the late summer,
when he has shed his wing feathers and is, for a period
flightless. This is a part of Nature&rsquo;s plan to give her
feathered children protection when they most need it.
While the females are sitting upon the eggs, they are
deserted by the males, which congregate in large flocks,
and drift aimlessly about until joined by the females
in Fall.</p>

<p>Male black with a white patch on top of the head
and another on the nape; eye white; bill red, white and
yellow, with a large black spot near the base. Female
a uniform grayish brown, lighter below, with a whitish
patch in front of each eye; young birds are like the
female but also have a white patch back of the eye.
That they are very abundant is apparent from the size
of a single flock seen by Nelson about 10 miles out to
sea from St. Michaels, Alaska; it formed a continuous
band for about 10 miles in length and from a half to
three-quarters of a mile in width. All the &ldquo;Coots&rdquo;
have heavy bodies, making it rather difficult for them
to rise from the water, along which they run for a few
yards before springing into the air.</p>

and reddish-brown back, breast and sides. In winter,
the cheeks are duller colored and the back mixed with
grayish. Female with crown, back and sides grayish;
cheeks showing traces of white as on the male. These
ducks are very sprightly, either in the water, on land,
or a-wing. Their flight is very rapid, their stiff, short
wings producing a buzzing sound that gives them the
local name of Bumble Bee Coot. They have a great

<p>Head and neck white, often tinged with rusty on the
face; underparts brownish-gray. Young birds are similar
but the head is brownish; bill and feet reddish;
eye brown. This handsome goose is found only in the
interior, but a few accidental birds have been taken on
the Atlantic and two on the Pacific coasts. While it
is not an abundant species, flocks of twenty or thirty are
often seen in the Mississippi Valley. They are sometimes
seen with <a href="#bLesserSnowGoose">Snow Geese</a>, but for the most part keep
by themselves. On their march to their breeding grounds
they branch off from the routes chosen by the <a href="#bLesserSnowGoose">Snow Geese</a>,
and turn to the eastward, breeding east of Hudson Bay,

<p>Forehead, white; head and neck gray; underparts
mixed black and white; feet yellow; bill pinkish; eye
brown. These geese reach the U. S. on their return from
the Arctic regions about the first of October; they are
very abundant on the Pacific coast and fairly common
in the Mississippi Valley, but are rare on the Atlantic
coast. They are very noisy birds and in some sections
of the country are known as Laughing Geese. From
being shot at so frequently, they are very wild and
difficult to approach, sentinels being stationed to give
alarm if danger approaches, when they are feeding.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A confused honking, likened to laughter.</p>

<p>The best known and most widely distributed of our

looked for in the Spring, for their arrival is a sure
indication that the backbone of Winter has broken.
Their familiar honking is heard long before the thin,
wavering, black, V-shaped line appears on the horizon;
as it draws nearer, the volume of sound increases, resembling
the baying of a pack of hounds, and at last,
the flock sweeps overhead with deafening cries; large
birds, with long necks fully outstretched, wings beating
the air in unison, and all following the leadership of
one bird in their journey over their invisible path.</p>

<p>Head, back and breast black, sharply defined against
the grayish-white of the underparts; a whitish patch
on either side of the neck. They are very abundant on
the Atlantic coast in winter, and when not too persistently
hunted are unsuspicious; they do not fly in
regular formation like the <a href="#bCanadaGoose">Canada geese</a>, nor do they
appear to have any special leader. They are inquisitive
and easily decoyed, and consequently large numbers of
them are shot annually. They are noisy, their notes
being a peculiar, guttural &ldquo;car-r-r-rup&rdquo; or &ldquo;r-r-rup,&rdquo;
and when in the presence of a large flock, the sound is
deafening. (Elliott).</p>
<p>They feed upon tender water plants and roots, which
they get from the bottom by tipping up, and not by

<p>Legs and neck long; bill and feet pinkish; eye brown;
head and neck chiefly gray; breast and back brownish;
belly and under tail coverts, black; wing-coverts white
and gray. These peculiar shaped ducks are not rare in
certain localities along the Rio Grande in Southern
Texas, and are abundant in Mexico and Central America.
They are not timid and are frequently caught and
domesticated. They can walk and run gracefully, and
often feed in grain fields at considerable distance from
water; they also eat shoots and seeds of aquatic plants.
Like the <a href="#bWoodDuck">Wood Duck</a>, they nest in hollow trees, often
at some distance from water, and, as soon as the young
appear, help them to the ground and lead them to the
water.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A loud, shrill whistle.</p>

the United States than the <a href="#bBlackBelliedTreeDuck">Black-bellied</a>, and is casually
found as far north as Kansas and Nevada, while it is
regularly found in Texas and Louisiana, where it is
known as the Long-legged Duck. Owing to the nature
of its diet, which consists chiefly of grain, roots and
water plants, the flesh of this bird is esteemed as an
article of food, and many are killed for such. When
wounded, they are said to be difficult to capture, owing
to the speed at which they can run; they also swim
and dive well.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Located in the hollow of a tree, the bottom of
the cavity usually being lined with feathers. They lay
from ten to fifteen pure white eggs, and as many as

<p>These large, beautiful birds are found in Southern
Florida, and casually north to South Carolina, but it is
doubtful if they breed within our limits. They fly with
their long neck fully extended and legs trailing behind,
a remarkable sight when a flock of several thousand is
seen in flight. In 1904, Mr. F. M. Chapman visited a
large breeding colony in the Bahamas, photographing
the birds in every conceivable position. Their nests are
mud-built structures, about a foot high, placed close
together in the marshy interior of low lying islands,
or on sandbars. The top is slightly hollowed out to
receive the single egg (3.40 &times; 2.15), which is covered
with a chalky deposit. They sit astride the nest with
their legs doubled under them.</p>

majority of specimens have been taken in Florida and
Ontario, with one each from Michigan and Massachusetts.
There are about twenty of them known to be

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">192. </span><span class="sci">Ardea occidentalis. </span><span class="siz">50 in.</span></div>
<p>This is the largest heron that we get in North America,
surpassing even the <a href="#bGreatBlueHeron">Great Blue</a>. Its plumage is
entirely white; no &ldquo;aigrettes&rdquo; on the back, but two
white plumes on the back of the head and the feathers
of the breast much lengthened, the same as in adult
<a href="#bGreatBlueHeron">Blue Herons</a>; bill, eyes and legs yellow. A gray phase
of this heron, or a hybrid between it and the
<a href="#bGreatBlueHeron">Great Blue Heron</a>, is occasionally found in Southern Florida;
it is similar to the Blue Heron, but paler and with the
head and neck white.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A large platform of sticks placed in the tops

<p>Adult Blue Herons are very handsome birds, as may
be seen in the illustration. Young birds, and nine out
of ten that we see will be young birds, are much duller
colored and have no plumes. It takes several years
for them to attain their perfect plumage. Their nests
are placed in the tops of the tallest trees and are, consequently,
difficult to get at. In some heronries, trees
have been found containing as many as 40 nests. In
flight, herons always carry their head drawn in against
the shoulders, the neck being curved below.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A platform of sticks in tall trees in wet woods.
3 or 4 pale greenish-blue eggs (2.50 &times; 1.50); May, June.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds locally throughout the United States
and Canada, either in colonies, or single pairs where

<p>Entirely white, with no plumes on the head but with
a long train of straight &ldquo;aigrette&rdquo; plumes growing
from the middle of the back; bill and eye, yellow; legs
and feet, black. Young and adults in winter, without
plumes. The hand of man, to gratify the desire of
woman, has ruthlessly slaughtered thousands upon thousands
of these exquisitely beautiful birds; in Florida
where they were abundant a few years ago, only stragglers
are seen. A few of these heronries are yet left,
either because they are in wildernesses where man has
not yet penetrated, or are strongly protected by the
humane owners of the land. It is only at the breeding
places that they can be killed in numbers, as at other
times they are shy; and it is only during nesting season
that they wear their beautiful plumes.</p>

recurved plumes growing from the middle of the back;
long crest of plumes on the back of the head, and on
the breast. Bill black, greenish at the base and about
the eyes; legs black; feet yellow. This species is the
most beautiful of the Egrets and consequently is the one
that has suffered most from &ldquo;plume hunters.&rdquo; Although
they are now protected wherever they can be,
their ranks have been so decimated that extermination
is threatened within a few years; the demand for their
plumes is still so great that lawless men will commit
murder to obtain them (Warden Bradley having been
shot in 1905, while preventing the destruction of herons

reddish-brown; rest of plumage gray, the plumes on the
back being lightest; feet blue-black; bill yellowish
at the base and black at the tip. In the white phase,
the plumage is entirely, or nearly, white, including the
plumes. As usual, these egrets associate in large flocks,
of their own kind or other small herons. Their food
consists of small fish, frogs, lizards, insects and mice.
They will stand motionless in shallow water, for a long
time waiting for their prey, and woe to the creature
that comes within striking distance of their spear-like
bill. Their flight is strong and graceful as they make
their way from their breeding places to their feeding

white; head and neck reddish-purple; back and wings
slaty; crest whitish; bill and legs dark; eyes red. A
very abundant species throughout the year, on the Gulf

usually with a tinge of bluish on the forehead and ends
of the wings. They can be distinguished from the similar
<a href="#bSnowyHeron">Snowy Herons</a> by the greenish-black legs, while the
legs of the latter are black with yellow feet. These
little herons are resident and most abundant in the
South Atlantic and Gulf States. They are at home in

where only birds or reptiles can tread with safety.
Yet herons are an interesting group and, in their own

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">201. </span><span class="sci">Butorides virescens. </span><span class="siz">17 in.</span></div>
<p>Smallest of the family, except the Least Bittern. In
breeding plumage, they are one of the most beautiful
of herons. They may be found in marshes, along creeks
or about the edges of shallow ponds or lakes. They
are often seen sitting upon a partly submerged log
sunning themselves, or waiting for a tempting frog or
fish to pass within reach. When they are among rushes,
they will usually attempt to escape observation by
mimicking their surroundings, and they do so very successfully.
When they are alarmed and take flight they
utter a single sharp shriek. At other times they utter
a series of hollow screams, &ldquo;qu-ick, qu-ick,&rdquo; and also a
hollow croak.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In bushes, in communities or in company with

of their feeding after dusk, sleeping during the greater
part of the day. Their heronries are usually located in
swamps, and preferably in coniferous trees. A visit to
one of these is very interesting, but old clothes must
be worn, for their homes are filthy. On your approach,
the old birds flap away, and circle about with squawks
of disapproval, and all the young birds commence a
loud ticking noise, like what would be produced by hundreds

<p>Like the last species, the head of this one is adorned
with three long, rounded, white plumes; in life these
plumes are rarely separated, but are nested together so
that there appears to be but one. As dusk approaches,
these birds sally out from their roosting or nesting
places, and with slow, measured flaps, wing their way
to their feeding grounds, which are usually fresh water
bogs, teeming with animal and insect life. After dark
the &ldquo;quark&rdquo; of Night Herons is frequently heard as
the birds pass overhead, and they can very easily be
decoyed by a crude imitation of their call. This species
is principally confined to the South where it is found in
heronries of its own kind, or in company with others.</p>

<p>These singular birds are the connecting link between
the cranes and the rails. They are rarely seen in flocks,
usually living a secluded life in pairs. They are often
known as the &ldquo;crying bird,&rdquo; because of the peculiar
wailing cries that they utter, both in daytime and after
nightfall. They are great skulkers, and it is difficult
to make them fly; when they do take wing, it is only to
go a few rods before dropping into the shelter of the
reeds again. They can run rapidly, having a peculiar
mincing gait, that is said to have given them the name
of Limpkin.</p>

one prefers fresh water marshes. They have a great
aversion to flying, and, like other rails, will trust to
their legs for safety, should danger threaten; probably
no other birds are as dexterous as the rails in threading
their way through the close standing rushes. Although
they do not have webbed feet, they can swim
fairly well, and also dive, but they do so only when
they are forced to. They look extremely awkward as
they run over the trash on the marsh, their head and

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">218. </span><span class="sci">Ionornis martinicus. </span><span class="siz">13 in.</span></div>
<p>Bill shorter and stouter than that of the rails, and
with a hard shield at the base, that extends on the forehead
to the top of the head. This species is beautifully
colored with purplish-red and blue on the underparts,
and greenish on the back and wings; legs yellow; bill
carmine, tipped with yellow. The habits of the gallinules
are practically the same as those of the rails.
They inhabit marshes, where they creep cautiously but
rapidly through the upright stalks, or run over the
slimy surface, where none but birds with extremely long
toes could get a foothold. Their powers of flight are
weak, and they do not take wing unless they are cornered
or wish to cross some stream.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Woven of grasses and rushes, and placed either
on the ground or attached to living rushes, usually over
the water; their 5 to 10 eggs are rich cream color,
spotted with reddish brown (1.60 &times; 1.15).</p>

<p>Bill and crown plate, red, tipped with yellow; legs

changing to blackish on the head and neck. Florida
Gallinules are very noisy, especially during the mating
and breeding season, and marshes in the south, where
they breed by hundreds, fairly ring with their cries
chuckles and squawks. They have an almost endless
variety of notes but all of them are harsh and explosive.
At times they appear to be stupid, and allow anyone to
approach in a boat, near enough to touch them with an
oar. When frightened, and with no protecting rushes
to conceal them, they will rush off over the grass and
water, with much spattering and squawking.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually fastened in the marsh grass or flags

<p>Bill and frontal shield as in the gallinules, but the
bill is whitish with a blackish ring near the tip; each
individual toe is furnished with a large scalloped web;
otherwise their plumage is grayish like that of the
<a href="#bFloridaGallinule">Florida Gallinule</a>. Coots are, locally, very abundant
throughout temperate North America in summer. Like
gallinules, they inhabit reedy pools, sluggish streams
and boggy marshes, where they are at least safe from
human pursuit. They conceal themselves among the
reeds, so as to escape observation, taking wing only
when they are obliged to. They are expert swimmers,
and can dive and swim for long distances under water;
in this respect they have a decided advantage over the
rails and gallinules.</p>

<p>Bill heavier than any of the other phalaropes; feet
lobate-webbed. Adults in summer have the entire underparts
reddish brown; side of head white; upper parts
gray, white and black. In winter, head and underparts
are white; back gray. Phalaropes differ from any other
of our birds, in that the female is the larger and brighter
plumaged bird, and the duties of incubation are largely
or chiefly performed by the male bird. These phalaropes
are very rarely seen in the United States in their breeding
plumage; when they come in the Fall, nearly all
have changed to their dull winter dress, and they keep
this until after they leave us in the Spring.</p>

reddish-brown breast; gray upper parts mixed with
white and buff; throat and belly, white. Male, similar
but duller colored. In winter, the upper parts are gray
mixed with white, and the underparts are pure white.
This is a maritime species that nests in the far north,
and appears on our coast only for a short time during
migrations. Like the last, they are expert swimmers
and pass most of their time, when not breeding, upon
the surface of the water, where they can outride the
most severe storms in safety. They feed upon minute
insects that they secure from beds of floating kelp.</p>

<p>Bill long and slender. Female in summer with a
black line through eye, shading into a broad stripe
of rich chestnut on the sides of the neck. Male much
duller colored and slightly smaller. This phalarope
is one of the most beautiful of all our shore birds,
and is the most southerly distributed of the phalaropes.
It is a bird of the interior, and is only rarely or casually
met with on the sea coasts. It commonly travels
about in small companies instead of large flocks as the
other two species do, and is not as often seen on the
water, although it can swim well.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;Usually silent, but has a low quack.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of grasses, on the ground, usually concealed

<p>Bill slender and recurved; feet webbed; feathers on
the underparts very thick and duck-like, being impervious
to water. In summer, the head and neck are pale
cinnamon color; young birds and winter adults have
the head and neck white, but the rest of the plumage
is the same as in summer. These interesting waders
are very abundant in some localities on the western
plains. During the breeding season, if not molested,
they become very tame; at other times they are quite
wary. Their food consists of water insects and small
Crustacea, which they secure in a novel manner. Wading
along in shallow water, with their head immersed,
they keep their bill moving from side to side through
the soft mud.</p>

These very long-legged creatures are found in suitable
places west of the Mississippi River, and are especially
abundant in southern California. Stilts are poor swimmers,
but habitually feed in comparatively deep water,
that is up to their bodies, their whole head, neck and
upper parts of the body often being submerged while
thus engaged. They are strong and swift on the wing,
twisting as they fly, so as to alternately show their
black upper parts, then the white surfaces beneath; this
is a habit that is common to several varieties of shore
birds.</p>

mottled with black, brown and gray. These peculiar
birds are very well known throughout their range, to
gunners and sportsmen, who have been the means of
almost completely exterminating them in some localities.
They are found in runs along the edges of brooks,
where the mud is soft. Their food is of worms, insects
and their larv&aelig;, which they get from the ground by
boring with their long bills. Their flight is very rapid,
and when startled they double and twist in their haste
to get away, their three narrow outer wing feathers
producing a peculiar whistling sound.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A low peep, and a twittering.</p>

the <a href="#bAmericanWoodcock">Woodcock</a>, being found in marshes or along open
brooks. Like the <a href="#bAmericanWoodcock">Woodcock</a>, they often lie still and
trust to their colors to prevent their being seen, but if
they are observed, and they are always on the alert,
they instantly take wing and pursue a zigzag course out
of sight. Like the last species they procure their food
by boring, the tip of the bill being flexible, so they can
grasp their food when they feel it.</p>

They seem to be one of the least abundant of our shore

species, rather than in flocks of themselves. They are
usually more shy than the birds with which they are

<p>Bill long and slightly recurved. Back, wings and tail,
rufous, barred with black; rump usually white, with
black bars; underparts pale rufous with narrow bars;
head grayish, with black streaks on the crown and
sides. Young similar, but whiter below and with few
or no bars. These large waders are found in moderately
large flocks both in the interior and on the coast in the
fall. They frequent salt marshes on the coast, and the
borders of ponds and lakes in the interior. They are
much hunted and are consequently very wary, usually
taking wing as soon as anyone appears in sight. They
are readily decoyed, and thousands perish annually at
the hands of sportsmen. They are known by many
names, Marlin and Straight-bill Curlew probably being
the most commonly used.</p>

deep reddish-chestnut, barred, chiefly on the sides, with
black. In winter, similar but duller both above and
below, with only traces of bars on the flanks, and with
the breast more or less streaked. This species is more
abundant on the Atlantic coast during migrations than
the last. It is most often known as the Ring-tailed
Marlin, owing to a very strong contrast between the
black tail, white rump and dark upper parts as the
bird flies. They are usually found in the marshes back
of the ocean beach, and, owing to their large size, can
be seen for a long distance.</p>

rarely near water. West of the Miss. they are
said to occur in large flocks in the Fall, but in the East,
half a dozen or so would be considered a fair sized flock.
They feed upon small grasshoppers and other small insects,
sometimes chasing them for a considerable distance

with rufous and blackish above; bright buffy or rufous
below, streaked on neck and breast, and barred on the

often called, are the largest of our shore birds. They
are very conspicuous either when flying or walking on
the marshes or sandbars, their size appearing gigantic
when they are in a flock of smaller plover, as sometimes
happens. They fly in compact flocks, evidently led by
one individual, for they wheel and circle in perfect

It is found in fresh and salt water marshes, as well as
on mud-flats and on sandy beaches of the seashore.
They are very unsuspicious and are easily stalked, or
decoy very easily, coming to wooden caricatures of themselves
stuck up in the mud, or to crude imitations of
their whistles; consequently large numbers of them are
shot and they are becoming scarce.</p>

blackish. Primaries and most of the secondaries plain
brownish-black, without the variegation of the last species.
A few years ago this was considered the most
abundant of the curlews, but so persistently have they
been hunted that they are now practically exterminated.
When it comes to looking after their safety, curlews
are, perhaps, the most stupid of the shore birds for they
do not seem to realize the dangerous character of mankind
in general, and they have paid the penalty. I trust

<p>Bill very long, heavy, compressed, and thin and chisel-like
at the tip. Bill and eye, red; legs flesh color.
These large, awkward looking birds are not scarce on
the South Atlantic coast, where they are met with in
pairs or small companies. They run with great swiftness,
or walk sedately along the beaches and marshes
gathering insects and fiddler crabs, of which they are
very fond. They are said to have got their name from
the habit of eating oysters when they found them with
the shell open, a practice that would be extremely hazardous
for them to undertake, as these shellfish close
their two valves very quickly and would be apt to catch
the bird. Owing to their large size they are frequently
shot at and, consequently, are usually shy.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A depression in the sand; the two or three
eggs are buffy, spotted with blackish-brown (2.20 &times;

<p>A very peculiar species. Bill plover-like; at the base,
terminating in a leaf-like sheaf that covers the forehead;
a hard spur on the shoulder of each wing; legs
and toes extremely long, the toenails being abnormally
so, the hind nail often being an inch and a half long.
Young very different from the adult.&mdash;Grayish-brown
above, with wings greenish-yellow as in adult; below
whitish, darker across the breast and on the sides; a
light line above the eye. Jacanas are inhabitants of
marshy, muddy pools and ponds, where they can easily
run over the surface, their long toes getting a good
foothold on the floating aquatic plants. They are said
to be very pugnacious in defence of their young, and also
to fight among themselves during the mating season.</p>

clownish; general color of the female, pinkish brown
with streaks of black, and white specks, below, and
barred and streaked above. These strange birds are
very local in their distribution in the southwest, rare
in some localities and occurring in quite large flocks in

this, in connection with their clownish plumage, has
given them the name of &ldquo;Fool&rdquo; Quail. They frequent
dry deserts, valleys, or mountains up to an elevation of

reddish brown or gray, independent of age or sex of
bird. These naturally wild, shy grouse are the kings
of the eastern game birds, their wariness and speed with
which they will dodge through the trees being the only
reasons they have so long withstood the hunting to
which they are subjected. During spring, the male

dry sagebrush-covered plains about the Rocky Mts. and
to the westward. In summer they feed largely upon
insects and buds of various plants, but in fall and
winter, their food is almost entirely the leaves of the
sagebrush; at this season, in consequence, their flesh
is unfit to eat, so they are not hunted for market, and
are able to pursue a life of quiet as far as man is
concerned. In spring, they indulge in amusing play,
as do all the grouse; they have a few wiry hairs on
either side of the neck, covering the naked sacs that
correspond to those of the <a href="#bPrairieHenPinnatedGrouse">Prairie Hen</a>; they strut

<p>The male of this beautiful pheasant varies greatly

sometimes being 36 in. in length; the female averages
about 22 in. and is plain colored, but still a
very handsome bird. Males vary greatly in the richness
of their colors, and in the width of the white
collar on the neck, the latter depending upon the extent
to which they have been interbred with the English
Pheasant, the latter bird having no white on the
neck. These pheasants have been introduced in Oregon
and Washington and are very abundant there now.
Attempts at introducing them in the East have not been
as successful, but in some private preserves they are
doing well. They are rather sluggish in their habits,

escape by running or hiding rather than by taking wing;

Only a few years ago, up to 1880, they were extremely
abundant in eastern North America. Seemingly incredible
stories are told of the immense flocks and roosting
places of these birds, and most of them are authentic.
It is unfortunate that the camera was not extensively
used then, so we have no visual records of them. A
nesting place in Michigan is described as 28 miles in
length by about four in width, and every tree in the
woods, throughout this whole tract, had several nests,
and some were filled with them. Flocks darkening the
sky and covering several square miles are recorded.
And, today, but one or two stragglers are reported in
a year, and these are usually doubtful. They were
shot and netted at their roosting and nesting places,
barreled up and sent to market for sale, this continuing
so long as there were birds enough to make it profitable,
and we reap the result&mdash;no birds.</p>

<p>Upperparts olive-brown; below, buffy-gray; a small
black mark on the ears above the iridescent neck patch.</p>
<p>These birds never flock as <a href="#bPassengerPigeon">Passenger Pigeons</a> did,
traveling in companies of six to a dozen, and they have
no common nesting or roosting places, but nest anywhere
in the woods, orchards or vines. As they are
not often hunted, they are not shy, and in some localities
are very tame, especially when they are breeding.
Their food consists of seeds, grain, berries and insects,
most of which they get from the ground. They nest
either in trees, bushes or on the ground, most often
the former. Their nests are very frail platforms, composed
of only a few twigs and rootlets; when on the
ground, usually no nest is made. Their two eggs are
pure white, as are those of all doves. They are loving
birds, always cooing to each other, and are very attentive
to their young until they are full grown.</p>

southern Canada, except northern New England and
the Provinces.</p>

is very swift and swallow-like; at times they circle
about for long periods, on motionless wings; at others,
they will be seen swooping over marshes and low

This tropical species is found in the United States, only
in the southern half of Florida, in the densest swamps,
being fairly abundant in the Everglades. They are said
to feed exclusively upon a certain species of water snail,
and each bird has a particular perch to which he takes
every snail he captures, and after skillfully extracting
the animal with its curiously modified beak, it drops
the shell on the mound beneath. (Bendire).</p>

most abundantly in or around marshes or wet meadows.
I have found them especially abundant in boggy marshes
such as frequented by bitterns. Their flight is quiet
and owl-like, and as they do most of their feeding
toward dusk, they often seem like owls as they flit
by without a sound. Their food is composed chiefly of
meadow mice and moles, which they spy and dash
down upon as they fly at low elevations.</p>

<p>This little hawk, so near like the <a href="#bCooperHawk">Cooper</a>, is one of
the most active of the family, and from this fact it
gets its name <i>velox</i>, meaning swift. It is often seen
in woods, orchard, or even about buildings in large
cities, in which latter places, it does good service in
catching English Sparrows. If they would confine
their food to these birds, no one would object, but unfortunately
they will take any little bird that comes
within their reach, or that they are able to catch.
They are one of the very few hawks that do live
largely upon birds, and even they destroy a great
many mice.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A shrill, three-syllabled whistle.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A rude and usually frail structure of twigs,

<p>This hawk is a large edition of the last species. All
hawks vary in size, this one and the last, perhaps,
more than any others. Female hawks are always the
largest. A large female of the <a href="#bSharpShinnedHawk">Sharp-shinned variety</a>,
is often as large as a small male Cooper, but the
crown of the Cooper is darker than that of the Sharp-shinned,
and his tail is always rounded, while that of
the last species is nearly square at the end. This is
also a destructive species; it is usually one of these
two hawks, or the <a href="#bAmericanGoshawk">Goshawk</a>, that is responsible for
the ill-feeling with which farmers regard all of the
family. All small hawks are known to farmers as
&ldquo;Chicken Hawks,&rdquo; and large ones as &ldquo;Hen Hawks,&rdquo;
but the majority of our hawks rarely disturb fowls.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of sticks in crotches of trees, usually quite

a whitish line over the eye; below white, finely waved
with gray. Young, brownish-black, with lighter edgings
to the feathers; below whitish, streaked with
blackish-brown. Young birds can easily be distinguished
from those of any other species by their large
size and the long tail. This handsome species is one
of the most rapacious and destructive of our birds
of prey. Their short wings and long tail enable them
to glide among the thickest foliage with great speed,
and even the Ruffled Grouse cannot escape them. In
the north where they live in summer, they destroy
great numbers of Ptarmigan and Spruce Grouse, and
come to us in the winter with their appetite whetted
for a diet of poultry and our game birds, being exceedingly
bold in their capture.</p>

Young with rusty edgings to feathers on
the back; below, rusty buff with blackish spots or
streaks; thighs barred with blackish. Space in front
of eye, bare except for stiff hair-like bristles, yellowish
like the cere. This species is the connecting link
between the vultures and hawks of the genus <i>buteo</i>.
Its feedings habits are similar to those of the vultures,
with which it often associates when feeding upon
carrion. They are very sluggish birds and their flight
is slow and heavy; when not feeding they are usually
perched on one foot on some dead limb, dozing.</p>

without a narrow blackish band near the tip; below
white, with a band of blackish streaks across the
breast, and dusky markings on the sides. Young birds
are similar, but have the tail grayish-brown with
black bands. An examination of the food of this bird
of prey, made by the Department of Agriculture, shows
that, instead of living upon poultry as most farmers
think, their food consists chiefly of frogs, snakes, lizards,
mice and insects, less than one in ten of the
stomachs examined containing any remains of poultry.</p>

Usually one or more pairs will be found in a piece of
woods. One pair that I know, and I presume it is
the same pair, each year has its nest on the edge of a
colony of Black-crowned Night Herons and, during the

<p>This species has the greatest variety of plumages
of any of our hawks. It has only three outer primaries
notched near the tips, while the two last species,
which are the only ones that can be confused with it,
have four. Adults in the light phase have a band of
rich chestnut across the breast. Adults in the dark
phase are uniform blackish-brown, with some rusty
edgings and with thighs more or less rusty. Young
birds are buffy below, with elongated blackish spots.
Its harmless character can be understood from the
fact that it is no unusual sight to find other birds,
such as Arkansas Kingbird and Bullock Oriole, nesting
in the same tree; and the first mentioned species
goes even further than this, sometimes constructing
its home in the sides of the nests of the hawks.</p>

<p>Legs feathered to the toes. Adults blackish on the
back and belly; head and breast, more or less grayish-white,
streaked with dusky; tail white, barred on the
end with black; eyes brown. In the dark phase they
are blackish-brown, more or less mixed with rusty.
This large, heavily-built species is found in the United
States, only in winter; it frequents thinly wooded districts
or meadows, where it catches its prey, which
consists of small rodents, insects and reptiles. It is
very irregular in its appearance, especially in the east,
but it is most often found near the coast. It is a
sluggish species and I doubt if it does any harm to
wild birds or to poultry; it certainly does a great deal
of good.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Of sticks, on rocky ledges; eggs bluish-white,
boldly splashed with brown (1.90 &times; 1.55).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds north of the United States border;
winters in northern United States.</p>

birds of prey are fairly abundant in thinly settled
country west of the Miss., especially in mountains
and foot-hills. They are very powerful birds and a
single pair of them will rule the whole country in which
they reside. They are very shy in the presence of
man and will never attack a person or show fight
unless wounded or surprised at their meals. Their

valor. Their feet are exceptionally large, and they are
often, on this account, known as Great-footed Hawks.</p>

thighs; streaked on the breast and barred on the flanks
with black; tail with four black bands. Female and
young, blackish brown above; below streaked with
dusky. These little falcons are very bold and courageous
when led by the pangs of hunger, chasing their
prey close to human beings, and they have been known
to follow birds, which, in their fright, have dashed
through windows in houses. They live upon any of the
smaller birds, as well as rodents, grasshoppers and
other insects.</p>

the tail is crossed by six light bars. The habits of this
species, which seems to have quite a limited range, are
precisely like those of the <a href="#bPigeonHawk">Pigeon Hawk</a>. Like that
species, it flies swiftly, with rapidly beating wings, and
occasionally sails and soars. The under surface of the

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">360. </span><span class="sci">Falco sparverius. </span><span class="siz">10.5 in.</span></div>
<p>This is the smallest and one of the handsomest of our
hawks. Cannot be mistaken for any other species, because
of its bright colors and odd marking. The female
is barred on the back, wings and tail, while the male
has but a few short bars on the back. The general tone
of both, above, is a bright rusty-brown. This is the
most abundant hawk that we have, and it is also best
known, chiefly because it is found commonly in the vicinity
of farmhouses and commonly on the outskirts of
cities. Their flight is peculiar, a few rapid wing beats,
then a short sail, alternately. They are very noisy in
mating season and when the young birds first fly, their
notes being a rapidly repeated, &ldquo;killy-killy-killy.&rdquo; Their
food is of grasshoppers, mice and rarely small birds.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually in cavities in trees, often in deserted
Flicker holes, the eggs being laid upon the bare wood.
They are cream colored, finely sprinkled and spotted
with brown (1.35 &times; 1.10).</p>

<p>These peculiar birds cannot be mistaken for any of
our hawks or falcons. They are very sluggish birds,
with habits resembling both those of buzzards and some
of the hawks. They are usually known in localities
where they are found, as Caracara Eagles. As we might
suspect from the shape of their bill, the naked and
bristle-covered lores, and the feet, which have not the
strongly hooked talons of hawks, the food of these birds
is largely carrion. It is terrestrial in its habits and is
most often seen, when not in flight, either upon the
ground, or standing erect on branches at low elevations.
They are more quarrelsome in their disposition than
are vultures, and frequently fight over their prey.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A bulky, but shabby pile of sticks and weeds,

<p>Real old birds have the head whiter, and less white
edging to the back feathers, than do the young. Feet
very strong, and very hard and rough, perfectly adapted
to grasping slippery fish; outer toe can be used equally as
well, either in front or behind, when perching or grasping
their prey. Their food is entirely of fish, which
they catch themselves, by plunging after it, hovering in
the air a few seconds while watching the fish, preparatory
to diving upon it. They are always found about
water and are very numerous on the seacoasts, where
twenty or more may frequently be seen at a time. They
are protected by law in some states, and by public sentiment
in most others.</p>

ear tufts; eyes small and brown; face very long; legs
very long. These peculiar owls are abundant in the
south, where they are commonly known as &ldquo;Monkey-faced

very useful birds, and are usually recognized as such.
Their food consists almost wholly of small squirrels,

breast are largely in the form of bars. In the northern
portions of the United States, this species is probably
the most abundant of owls, excepting the little <a href="#bScreechOwl">Screech Owl</a>.
It is often quite common, where its presence is
little suspected, because, unless disturbed, it flies only
at night and is a rather silent species. During the
daytime it is usually sitting upright in the dense tops

<p>Ear tufts very short; general color buffy, not nearly

They are not nearly as nocturnal as most of the owls,
and most of their hunting is done about dusk, when
they may be seen flying close to the ground over marshes
or low land. Their flight is perfectly silent, which aids
them in securing their prey of field mice, which they
usually get without stopping in their flight, just swooping
down, extending their long legs, armed with wicked
little claws, and it is all over with the little rodent, he
being carried to a nearby stump, and devoured, fur,
bones and all.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A very short, shrill cry, evidently their call

birds, and two of them like to get at opposite sides of a
piece of woods and talk to each other. Their notes are
very variable but are oftenest combinations of &ldquo;who-whos&rdquo;
and &ldquo;too-toos,&rdquo; often ending in a mournful wail.
They spend the day in slumber, unless routed out of
the dense trees where they rest, by crows or human
beings. They are one of the least harmful of the family

seasons of the year, in orchards. They remain mated
for life, and live in the same tree for years, if not too
much disturbed by curious boys. Both adults and the
four young are often found in the nest together, and
they offer no resistance when they are removed by
hand. Their food is almost wholly of insects and
rodents.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A wavering trill.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In holes of trees; eggs white (1.35 &times; 1.20).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Resident in U. S. and southern Canada.
373a. Florida Screech Owl (floridanus), is smaller
and slightly darker, 373b. Texas Screech Owl (mccalli),
is smaller and more heavily barred on the
sides.</p>

<p>Has ear tufts, thus distinguishing it from any other
of our large, powerfully built owls. These large birds
are the fiercest, most active and most destructive of
the family. Their size and strength allows them to
kill skunks and woodchucks, as well as poultry, grouse
and small mammals and birds. They seem to be especially
fond of skunks, and nearly all of them that I
have seen or handled, have given unmistakable evidence
of their recent and close association with these
animals.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b>&mdash;A deep, dismal &ldquo;who-who,&rdquo; and a loud unearthly
shriek.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually in deserted hawk or crow nests, and
also in hollow trees; eggs white (2.25 &times; 1.85). Feb.,
March.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds and resident from the Gulf to Labrador.
375a. Western Horned Owl (pallescens) is paler
colored; found in the plains and Rockies north to
Manitoba. 375b. Arctic Horned Owl (subarcticus), is
chiefly black and white; found in Arctic America, wintering
south to northern border of United States.</p>

<h3 id="bSnowyOwl">SNOWY OWL</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">376. </span><span class="sci">Nyctea nyctea. </span><span class="siz">25 in.</span></div>
<p>No ear tufts. Plumage white, more or less heavily
spotted with black, the female usually being quite
strongly barred on the back. They are locally abundant
in the far north, preferring low, mossy lands to the
more timbered districts. Here they find an abundance
of food during the summer months, living upon hares,
lemmings, ptarmigan and ducks. They are about the
equal of the <a href="#bGreatHornedOwl">Horned Owl</a> in strength, and usually will
weigh a few ounces more; they will frequently kill
animals or birds as heavy, or heavier, than themselves.
They also catch a great many fish; these they get in
shallow water among the rock-weed covered stones, by
reaching down quickly and seizing their prey in their
strong claws.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;On the ground in dry portions of marshes;
the 2 to 8 eggs are pure white.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds from Labrador and Hudson Bay,
northward, and possibly farther south; winters casually
to the Middle States, and commonly to Minnesota
and Maine.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">377a. </span><span class="sci">Surnia ulula caparoch. </span><span class="siz">15 in.</span></div>
<p>Tail long and rounded; plumage mottled black, white
and gray, with little, if any, brownish tinge; heavily
barred with black. These owls, curiously resembling a
hawk in build, and more so in flight, are very active
and hunt more during the daytime than after dark.
They feed largely upon small rodents and lemmings
which are very abundant in their summer home, and
also kill a great many small birds. They seem to be
impartial to wooded districts, or open marshes and
low lands, where they may be seen skimming about
close to the ground.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Either of sticks in the tops of trees, or in
hollow cavities. The eggs are white, as are those of
all owls, and nearly globular in shape (1.40 &times; 1.25).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds from Newfoundland and Manitoba
northward, and possibly farther south on the mountains.
Winters south to northern United States, rarely
to New York and Illinois.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">378. </span><span class="sci">Speotyto cunicularia hypog&oelig;a. </span><span class="siz">10 in.</span></div>
<p>Legs very long, and nearly bare on the lower part
of tarsi; tail short; no ear tufts. An abundant and
useful species in the prairie regions west of the Mississippi.
They live in the same region that prairie
dogs are found, using deserted burrows of these animals,
or taking them by force, for they are more than
a match for these curious animals; they do not, as
has often been said, live peaceably in the same burrows
with them. On the contrary, young prairie dogs,
as well as rodents, small snakes and birds, form a large
part of their daily diet. They are both diurnal and
nocturnal, doing most of their hunting after dusk, but
often seen sitting at the mouth of the burrow during
the daytime. The six to ten eggs that they deposit at
the end of these burrows are white.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;West of the Miss. Valley, north to Southern
Manitoba and British Columbia. 378a. Florida Burrowing
Owl (floridana), is smaller and whiter; found
in southern Florida.</p>
